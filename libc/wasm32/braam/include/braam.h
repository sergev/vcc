/*
 * <braam.h> — the Braam process ABI (docs/Braam.md §7; braam-core's
 * src/kernel/sysabi.h and doc/System_Calls.md).
 *
 * A process makes a request by yielding a braam_call: the runtime (libc/wasm32/braam/
 * rt.c) hands it to the kernel and resumes the coroutine with the reply.  braam_sys is
 * the one primitive; read, write, open, close, sleep_ms and fflush are built on it.  A
 * function that calls one is itself a coroutine yielding braam_call *, up to main:
 *
 *     coro(braam_call *) int main(int argc, char **argv);
 *
 * The numbers below are transcribed from sysabi.h; the braam-abi test compares them
 * with braam-core's when that tree is beside this one.
