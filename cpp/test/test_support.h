// Shared test harness and convenience matchers for the C11 preprocessor
// conformance suite, all exposed as methods of the PreprocessorTest fixture.
//
// Every test drives an external preprocessor (the "preprocessor-under-test",
// selected at configure time via the C11PP_COMMAND / C11PP_ARGS CMake cache
// variables) over a small source snippet and inspects the result.  The command
// and its base arguments are injected as compile-time string macros; see
// CMakeLists.txt.  Tests derive from PreprocessorTest (usually via a per-suite
// alias) so the harness and matcher calls read as plain one-liners.
//
// The fixture methods are declared here and implemented in test_support.cpp.
